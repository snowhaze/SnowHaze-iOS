One is a protocol called IPSec the other is OpenVPN. The VPN using IPSec can easily be controlled within the SnowHaze app, while OpenVPN requires you to use the OpenVPN Connect app and update your profiles monthly. However, OpenVPN is slightly more secure than IPSec. This is a small trade-off between usability (IPSec) and security (OpenVPN) that we can safely leave up to you.</p><p>SnowHaze VPN logs absolutely nothing and is the only VPN service using non-identifying authorization.</p><p>Subscribe to SnowHaze Premium to use the VPN and connect to one of our dedicated servers in the location of your choice. If you have not yet set the VPN please follow the steps in the online tutorial.</p><p><strong>Auto-Rotate Credentials:</strong> Automatically changes the login credentials for the server while connected to the VPN Server. Otherwise, the credentials change for every session.</p><p><strong>Auto-Update Location List:</strong> Updates the available VPN server locations</p><p><strong>Show Ping Status:</strong> Shows the time it takes for data to travel from your device to the server and back.</p><u>Note:</u> iOS 13 might fail to reroute the internet traffic through the VPN.";
